Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. 

Key Concepts:
1. Supervised Learning: Learning from labeled data to make predictions
2. Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
3. Reinforcement Learning: Learning through interaction with environment

Common Algorithms:
- Linear Regression for prediction
- Decision Trees for classification
- Neural Networks for complex patterns
- K-Means for clustering

Applications include image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles.
