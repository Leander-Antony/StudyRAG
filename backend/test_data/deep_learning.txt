Deep Learning Overview

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers. These networks can automatically learn hierarchical representations of data.

Architecture Components:
- Input Layer: Receives raw data
- Hidden Layers: Process and transform data
- Output Layer: Produces final predictions

Popular Architectures:
1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processing
2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential data
3. Transformers for natural language processing

Training Process:
- Forward propagation
- Loss calculation
- Backpropagation
- Weight updates using gradient descent

Deep learning has revolutionized computer vision, speech recognition, and language translation.
